# Election-Analysis
Automation and analysis of election results using python

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Election employees has given the task of completing the election audit of a recent local congressional election. Coding in Python was used to automate this process.
The following list of tasks were to be accomplished by the code:
1. Calculating the total number of votes cast
2. Generating a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Getting the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Finding the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
The code used Python 3.7.6 and Visual studio code 1.45.1 as the environment. The data source used for this project is saved under the folder 'Resources' in the name of 'election_results.csv'
